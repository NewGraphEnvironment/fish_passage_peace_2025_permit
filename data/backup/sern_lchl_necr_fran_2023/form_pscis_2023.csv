Very large deep outlet pool with extensive erosion undercutting the main pipe and 0.6 m overflow. Locally known as Dog Creek. Chinook captured upstream and downstream of Dog Creek FSR in 2021, 2022, and 2023 reported here https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/public/viewReport.do?reportId=62942.  Connected to the Nechako River with observed chinook points downstream adjacent to the confluence. Road edge is failing at the culvert and eroding into stream. Highly degraded site upstream that would be a good candidate for restoration.      ",Both the main pipe and the overflow are undercut with erosion on the downstream side. Road edge will likely be failing and peeling back continuously.,Pipes are very under sized for the size of stream with evidence of significant erosion already present. Washout would have negative consequences for environmental values downstream.          ,Back road could likely be closed with access from either side.
