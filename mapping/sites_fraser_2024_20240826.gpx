  <desc>bt_rearing - 2.3km. Very nice stream with good flow and abundant gravels upstream and downstream. Landowner indicated sockeye spotted along shoreline years ago. Massive outlet drop. Deserves habitat confirmation and consideration for replacement if no natural barriers upstream. There is a PSCIS assessed site (assessment_id = 7622) upstream that is a barrier.         </desc>

  <desc>bt_rearing - 1.7km. Very nice little stream with excellent flow for this time of year on a dry year. Crossing downstream on Gala Bay Road was fully embedded and passible at the time of the assessment. There is a historic chinook observation within this stream. This could be valuable Chinook rearing habitat and connectivity within the system should be restored, should no natural barriers be observed on a habitat confirmation assessment.           </desc>

Small debris jam near outletbackwatering pipe.

  <desc>bt_rearing - 6.3km. Very nice stream with excellent flow for this time of year on a dry year.  Very large deep outlet pool with extensive erosion undercutting the main pipe and 0.6 m overflow. Locally known as Dog Creek. Chinook captured upstream and downstream of Dog Creek FSR in 2021, 2022, and 2023 reported here https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/public/viewReport.do?reportId=62942.  Connected to the Nechako River with observed chinook points downstream adjacent to the confluence. Road edge is failing at the culvert and eroding into stream. Highly degraded site upstream that would be a good candidate for restoration.      </desc>

  <desc>bt_rearing - 36.3km. Two pipes (one at 1.8m, one at 1.5m), both with similar outlet drops. Inlet side has extensive beaver activity. Beaver dams are covering the inlet and culverts are not visible. Huge wetland upstream. Very big outlet pool so depth was estimated. Chinook were captured downstream of Settlement Road culvert in 2021 (https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/public/viewReport.do?reportId=61991) and Rainbow Trout observed in stream from 2021-2023 (https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/public/viewReport.do?reportId=61202 and https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/public/viewReport.do?reportId=62942). Culverts should be replaced and beaver activity managed. Habitat looks good downstream. High habitat value at crossing upstream. </desc>

Unassessed railway crossing approximately 200m upstream.  There is no crossing at the pipeline but construction activities have resulted in a small cascade of boulders at the pipe which is similar to the natural cascade section observed approximately 50m upstream.

  <desc>bt_rearing - 40.2km. Three pipes total, two at 1.2m diameter which were completely submerged underwater and one at 2m diameter which was 100% backwatered.  Assuming embedded due to the depth of the backwatering. Bridge located just upstream on River Road.  Unassessed railway crossing located downstream which, based off satalite imagery, leads to a wetland area, but no modelled crossing present.  There is a second unassessed crossing (24715896) downstream which should be assessed. Multiple non-salmonid FISS observations downstream. Chinook and sockeye salmon have been observed just upstream of the confluence of this creek with the Fraser River, rougly 1km downstream of the crossing.    </desc>
